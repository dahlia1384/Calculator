# Calculator
This is a basic calculator application created using C++ and the Qt framework. It supports fundamental arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, through an intuitive graphical interface.
# More Information
As I progress towards completing my degree, I thought I would share some of my programming skills (especially in C and C++ ðŸ˜‰) with the world!

I decided to start with something small and simple in my favourite programming languages, and it will expand in complexity as I make more repos in my GitHub!

Thanks :)
